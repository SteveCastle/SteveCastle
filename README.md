## Hi there 👋
My name is Stephen, I'm a software developer. I've worked at Vegas.com building cool travel products at Pluralsight building amazing learning experiences, and now at Hudl where we do awesome things for athletes and coaches. I also work on a lot of other projects in my spare time. Here are a few of them!
