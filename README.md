## Hi there 👋
My name is Stephen, I'm a software developer. I've worked at Vegas.com building cool travel products and now at Pluralsight building amazing learning experiences. I also work on a lot of other projects in my spare time. Here are a few of them!



## Released Projects ⭐️

### Code Workshop

A meetup group I've been hosting for the last year, and the blog where I write about things I've learned.

A react hook with the useState API but it's backed by simple cloud persistance.
